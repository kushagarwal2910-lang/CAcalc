# How to Deploy 'CAcalc' to GitHub

Since you want to manually upload the files, here is the step-by-step guide.

## 1. What to Upload
**YES, upload the entire contents of the `CAcalc` folder.**

You strictly need these files for the site to work:
- `index.html` (The main landing page)
- `style.css` (The styling)
- `theme.js` (The logic)
- All other `.html` files (e.g., `sip-step-up.html`, `tax-44ada.html`, etc.)

*Note: You do not need to upload the hidden `.git` folder if you are doing a manual upload.*

## 2. Steps to Upload Manualy
1.  Go to your GitHub Repository page.
2.  Click **Add file** > **Upload files**.
3.  Open your `CAcalc` folder on your computer.
4.  **Select all files** (Ctrl+A) inside the folder.
5.  **Drag and drop** them into the GitHub page.
6.  Wait for them to upload, then scroll down and click **Commit changes**.

## 3. How to Go Live (GitHub Pages)
Once the files are uploaded:
1.  Go to the repository **Settings**.
2.  Click **Pages** (in the left sidebar).
3.  Under **Branch**, select `main` (or `master`) and keep the folder as `/ (root)`.
4.  Click **Save**.
5.  Wait about 1-2 minutes. Refresh the page, and you will see a link (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name/`).

**Click that link, and your Financial Calculator Hub will be live!**
